# Pictographic

The Chinese characters (Han characters) seem complex with many strokes. But if you are given the original pictographic form of them, their original meaning would become easy to see. If you get the evolution of the characters, it would be not hard to understand how all the strokes had come to be. 

In this game, you would know hundreds of Chinese characters in an intuitive way. There is no any prior knowledge for Chinese characters is required.
